        <p>Hey, I'm Sarrick Shiflett. There's something magical about coding that captivates me—it's the thrill of being crafty and the pride that comes from creating something truly unique. I know right? ...tada! It sounds cliche, but seeing ideas come to life that have never been and knowing they’re useful or just plain fun is incredibly satisfying and I've found very few things feel close.</p>

        <p>I started coding a few years ago with Apple’s Swift while working at a local FedEx shipping dock. I quickly saw the potential to simplify everyday tasks and created a traffic app that scans for the perfect time to leave for work. The thrill of building something that makes a difference keeps me hooked.</p>

        <p>I’ve learned a bunch of programming languages since then, each one adding new skills and ideas. I enjoy the challenge of picking up new technologies and solving problems.</p>

        <p>When I’m not becoming one with machine, you’ll find me at the gym practicing Muay Thai. I briefly competed, now I dedicate my energy to being a "padman" and an instructor. Helping my teammates become champions has been incredibly rewarding and seeing them at their best and perhaps their worst has taught me a lot about resilience and teamwork to say the least.
        </p>

        <p>Muay Thai has introduced me to some great people and experiences. The hard work and dedication it takes have shaped who I am, both in the gym and in my coding.

        <p>Let’s connect and maybe work on something together. Whether it’s building the next cool app or sharing stories about coding and Muay Thai, I’m always up for a good chat!</p>
