        <p>Hey, I'm Sarrick Shiflett. The aspect of coding that captures my soul is the makers mindset. The thrill of bringing something in the mind to life, and the pride that comes with it. Ideas come to life that have never been and knowing they’re useful or just plain fun has an incredibly satisfying feeling to it and I've found very few things come close.</p>

        <p>I started my coding journey a few years ago with iOS, specifically Apple's new language, Swift, while working at a local FedEx. I quickly saw the potential to simplify everyday tasks, like my traffic app that scans for the perfect time to leave for work, saving me so much time in traffic! The thrill of building tools that simplify or ease everyday dilemmas keeps me hooked.</p>

        <p>I’ve learned a bunch of programming languages since then, each one adding new skills and principles. I enjoy the challenge of picking up new technologies and solving problems.</p>

        <p>When I’m not becoming one with machine, you’ll find me at the gym practicing the art of Muay Thai. I briefly competed, now I dedicate my energy to being what they call a "pad-man" and instructor. Helping my teammates become champions has been incredibly rewarding and seeing them at their best and perhaps their worst has taught me a lot about resilience and teamwork to say the least.
        </p>

        <p>Muay Thai has introduced me to some great people and experiences. The hard work and discipline it takes has shaped who I am, both in and out of the gym. The everything matters mindset, has helped me in coding and in my relationship with myself.
